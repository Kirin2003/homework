b. 

No, because forwarding rule is only based on destination address.


p4

The minimal number of time slots needed is 3. The scheduling is as follows.

Slot 1: send X in top input queue, send Y in middle input queue.  

Slot 2: send X in middle input queue, send Y in bottom input queue

Slot 3: send Z in bottom input queue. 

Largest number of slots is still 3. 

Based on the assumption that a non-empty input queue is never idle, the first time slot always consists of sending X in the top input queue and Y in either middle or bottom input queue, and in the second time slot, we can always send two more datagram, and the last datagram can be sent in third time slot.


p6:


a: 

the time at which packets 2 through 12 each leave the queue:

packet2: 1

packet3: 2

packet4: 3

packet5: 5

packet6: 4

packet7: 6

packet8: 7

packet9: 8

packet10: 9

packet11: 10

packet12: 11


For each packet, the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the time in which it is transmitted:

packet1 : delay = 0;

packet2 : delay = 1;

packet3 : delay = 1;

packet4 : delay = 2;

packet5 : delay = 2;

packet6 : delay = 2;

packet7 : delay = 3;

packet8 : delay = 2;

packet9 : delay = 3;

packet10 : delay = 2;

packet11: delay = 2;

packet12: delay = 3;

average delay: 23/12

b: 

the time at which packets 2 through 12 each leave the queue:

packet2: 2

packet3: 1

packet4: 6

packet5: 3

packet6: 7

packet7: 4

packet8: 9

packet9: 5

packet10: 10

packet11: 8

packet12: 11

For each packet, the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the time in which it is transmitted:

packet1 : delay = 0;

packet2 : delay = 2;

packet3 : delay = 0;

packet4 : delay = 5;

packet5 : delay = 0;

packet6 : delay = 5;

packet7 : delay = 1;

packet8 : delay = 4;

packet9 : delay = 0;

packet10 : delay = 3;

packet11: delay = 0;

packet12: delay = 3;

average delay: 23/12

c: 

the time at which packets 2 through 12 each leave the queue:

packet2: 2

packet3: 4

packet4: 1

packet5: 3

packet6: 6

packet7: 5

packet8: 7

packet9: 9

packet10: 11

packet11: 8

packet12: 10

For each packet, the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the time in which it is transmitted:

packet1 : delay = 0;

packet2 : delay = 2;

packet3 : delay = 3;

packet4 : delay = 0;

packet5 : delay = 0;

packet6 : delay = 4;

packet7 : delay = 2;

packet8 : delay = 2;

packet9 : delay = 4;

packet10 : delay = 4;

packet11: delay = 0;

packet12: delay = 2;

average delay: 23/12


d: 

For each packet, the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the time in which it is transmitted:

packet1 : delay = 0;

packet2 : delay = 2;

packet3 : delay = 0;

packet4 : delay = 4;

packet5 : delay = 0;

packet6 : delay = 5;

packet7 : delay = 1;

packet8 : delay = 4;

packet9 : delay = 1;

packet10 : delay = 3;

packet11: delay = 0;

packet12: delay = 3;

average delay: 23/12

e: the average delay in four cases are the same
